This conflose will hide a file in a hidden directory, and replace it with a file in which you have the binary representation of all the caracters of your original file.

Guide:

Write in your terminal :

	chmod +x binary.sh

(It gives the permission to binary.sh to be executed).

Then to execute the conflose write :

	./binary.sh <filename>

<filename> is the name of the file you want to hide and replace (NOT THE PATH! just the name).

Now everithing should be okay!
